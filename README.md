🌟 CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
This repository contains my solutions, projects, and notes from the CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course offered by Harvard University. The course dives deep into the concepts and applications of Artificial Intelligence, covering topics such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and neural networks.

📚 Course Overview
The course explores foundational AI concepts and equips learners to apply AI techniques in real-world scenarios. Key topics include:

Search Algorithms: Uninformed and informed search strategies.
Knowledge Representation: Logic and reasoning.
Uncertainty: Probabilistic models.
Machine Learning: Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Neural Networks: Concepts and implementation using TensorFlow.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Techniques for text understanding.
🚀 Repository Contents
1. Problem Sets
This section contains my solutions to the problem sets provided in the course. Each folder includes the code and any additional files required to run the solution.
